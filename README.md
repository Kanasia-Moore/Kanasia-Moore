### 🌱 About Me  

I’m a **data analyst and storyteller** who’s passionate about uncovering insights that bridge *human understanding* and *strategic action*.  

I started my journey by asking *why* — why certain communities lack opportunity, why audiences engage with specific campaigns, and why the stories behind data matter.  

That curiosity grew into a drive to **turn data into decisions** — the kind that create growth, awareness, and impact across both **social causes** and **business strategy**.

### 💡 My Focus  

> “The best data isn’t just accurate — it’s actionable and inspiring.”

I use **data visualization, storytelling, and analytical strategy** to reveal the *why* behind metrics. My work often lives at the intersection of **marketing performance**, **consumer behavior**, and **education equity** — because numbers only matter when they help us improve lives or drive results.

**Core Strengths:**
- 📊 Marketing analytics  
- 💬 Data storytelling  
- 💡 Sales performance tracking and KPI development  
- 🧩 Education and social impact analytics  
- 🕵🏽‍♀️ Problem solving using SQL, Python/R, and Tableau
